          <p>
            An economic and build overview of the action role-playing game Path
            of Exile based on public stash tab data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Path of Exile has a currency system consisting of various orbs and
            scrolls with no fixed value. Keeping on top of fluctuating exchange
            rates between the different currencies is almost impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this the game has a several hundred unique items that
            vary in price based on leagues, popular builds, patch notes and
            reddit posts .
          </p>
          <p>
            This site crunches the numbers and performs the calculations so all
            you have to worry about is finding your next Divine Orb.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            The site constantly consumes Path of Exile's Public Stash Tab API ,
            keeping track of all relevant items for sale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data is analyzed and aggregated to approximate exchange rates
            between currencies and prices of items. The aggregation contains
            several steps to counteract the price manipulation attempted by some
            sellers. Historical data is saved to track price developments over
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Updated exchange rates and prices are packaged up and pushed
            directly to your browser.
